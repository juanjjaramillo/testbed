```

If you had already added this repo earlier, retrieve the latest versions of the packages:
```shell
helm repo update
```

To see the available charts:
```shell
# `--devel` flag is only needed to show development
# versions (v0.0.0, alpha, beta, and release candidate releases)
helm search repo --devel testbed-charts
```
